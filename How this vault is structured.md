We've used three strategies to help you navigate our project:
1. The directory structure (viewable with the 'files' button in the lefthand sidebar) groups related notes together. Several directories also include an overview note, whose name is prefixed with an underscore.
2. Where the discussion can make useful reference to another section, we've inserted an inline link to that section.Â 
3. Concepts that appear in many places across the vault are tagged. You can ctrl-click a tag to search for other places it appears in the vault. You can also explore tags by clicking the 'tags' button in the righthand sidebar.
