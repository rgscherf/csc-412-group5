### Introduction
Our group chose to explore the presence of bias in computing technology, its common causes and remedies, and more interestingly, the evolving impact bias has on both human and computer-based decision-making. We present a collection of curated academic research papers and journal articles that span a series of independent and overlapping lines of inquiry, which themselves are organized  into four of the most prominent and reoccurring themes that emerged in our survey. 

### Definitions
We offer the following general definitions as a supplement to the navigation and understanding of the topics listed in the index below.

**Algorithmic Bias** - The systematic and repeatable errors in a computer system that create "unfair" outcomes, such as "privileging" one category over another in ways different from the intended function of the algorithm.

**Automation Bias** - The tendency of individuals to rely excessively on automated systems or technology, leading to a diminished level of vigilance or critical thinking, and potentially accepting or trusting the output of the automated system without appropriate verification or scrutiny.

**Decision Support Systems (DSS)** - An interactive computer-based system or software designed to assist decision-makers in solving complex problems or making decisions.

[[Background and theory of decision-making]]
These research papers encompass a variety of decision-making topics found in academic literature, such as group decision-making efficiency, real-time neural monitoring, models and modes of decision-making focusing on deviations from rationality, decision-making in significant life choices, and cross-cultural influences on reasoning, emotions, and values in decision-making. Collectively, these papers provide valuable insights into the intricacies of decision-making.

[[Types of Biases]]
The papers cover automation bias in decision support systems, where users tend to overly trust automated cues, potentially leading to errors. This bias has been linked to accidents due to excessive reliance on technology.  The papers suggest potential solutions and recommendations to the mentioned challenges.

[[Bias, decision-making, and AI]]
The papers in this section cover the impact of biases on professionals and their decision-making processes, shedding light on the potential of AI to either mitigate or exacerbate these biases. Furthermore, the transfer of bias from humans to AI is a key topic under consideration. The papers also delve into the manipulation of biases, exploring concepts like automation bias and selective adherence. Overall, there is a significant emphasis on AI's potential to eliminate bias across a wide range of industries.

[[_Bias and Decision Support Systems]]
The papers cover behavioural decision theory and discuss up to 37 cognitive biases. The papers particularly emphasize integrating cognitive bias theory into the development of decision support systems (DSS). Further, the papers covered how DSS may assist in alleviating decision biases linked to personal decision-making styles and risk attitudes.
