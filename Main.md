[[Background and theory of decision-making]]
These research papers encompass a variety of decision-making topics found in academic literature, such as group decision-making efficiency, real-time neural monitoring, models and modes of decision-making focusing on deviations from rationality, decision-making in significant life choices, and cross-cultural influences on reasoning, emotions, and values in decision-making. Collectively, these papers provide valuable insights into the intricacies of decision-making.

[[Types of Biases]]
The papers cover automation bias in decision support systems, where users tend to overly trust automated cues, potentially leading to errors. This bias has been linked to accidents due to excessive reliance on technology.  The papers suggest potential solutions and recommendations to the mentioned challenges.

[[Bias, decision-making, and AI]]
The papers in this section cover the impact of biases on professionals and their decision-making processes, shedding light on the potential of AI to either mitigate or exacerbate these biases. Furthermore, the transfer of bias from humans to AI is a key topic under consideration. The papers also delve into the manipulation of biases, exploring concepts like automation bias and selective adherence. Overall, there is a significant emphasis on AI's potential to eliminate bias across a wide range of industries.

[[_Bias and Decision Support Systems]]
The papers cover behavioural decision theory and discuss up to 37 cognitive biases. The papers particularly emphasize integrating cognitive bias theory into the development of decision support systems (DSS). Further, the papers covered how DSS may assist in alleviating decision biases linked to personal decision-making styles and risk attitudes.
