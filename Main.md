*Thoughts from Rob:* 

We should break these into smaller notes, since it looks like we need at least 5 (for an 80% grade). Some ideas:
- The DSS note is huge--we could find subcategories there.
	- For example things like wearable/passive DSS, DSS in structured systems (like business applications and medical diagnoses..)
- As previously mentioned on this page, we could rework the 'algorithmic bias' page into several interlinked 'types of bias' pages.
- We could also look at dividing the decision-making interventions into smaller top-level categories (outside of AI/not AI). 
- Good opportunities for backlinking are discussing the interventions in [[Bias, decision-making, and Decision Support Systems (DSS)]] [[Bias, decision-making, and AI]] in the context of articles in [[Algorithmic bias]] [[Background and theory of bias and decision-making]].
- Also, I chatted with Miguel and he encouraged us to be creative with our structure. Lots of links is enough for a good mark, but also think about other features like #tags. (We can easily incorporate tagging). Sounds like he doesn't have a clear idea of what a high mark looks like, but he'll know it when he sees it?
	- We should also definitely include commentary/summary of the readings similar to an annotated bibliography.
