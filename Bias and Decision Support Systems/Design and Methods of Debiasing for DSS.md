## Cognitive Biases and decision support systems development: a design science approach
### Arnott, D.
https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2575.2006.00208.x
- Paper reports a design science project attempting to provide guidance for people developing DSS grounded in behavioral decision theory (theory of cognitive bias)
- Claims there as 37 types of bias
- One stage of their project is the "construction of the design artefact: an evolutionary DSS development methodology that uses cognitive bias theory as a focusing construct, especially in its analysis cycles"

## Cognitive Bias, Decision Styles, and Risk Attitudes in decision making and DSS

- Decision Support Systems (DSS) are supposed to help improve decisions by acquiring and processing data and using it to guide decision making and help the user think more rationally.
- People have bias in their decision making that can lead to poor or less optimal decisions
- DSS can help reinforce biases to make better decisions
- Two conditions that influence a decision aid
	- Personal decision-making styles - the way in which people process and store info
	- Decision makers' attitude toward taking or avoiding risks - decisions involving risk imply that the most optimal outcome is not guaranteed.
- Discusses briefly 6 articles in which there are weaknesses in DSS's

## Augmented human mind: case of reasoning

- A suggested "radical method to #debiasing" using augmented reality. #physical-technologies
- "we made a first attempt to propose an approach of a system capable of augmenting the reasoning of his user."
- proposed system to to detect cognitive biases and change the environment as possibly with a smartphone or watch, HoloLens, or other #physical-technologies to modify the environment to debias situations.
