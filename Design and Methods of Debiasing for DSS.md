Cognitive Biases and decision support systems development: a design science approach
Arnott, D. (2005). Cognitive biases and decision support systems development: A design science approach. _Information Systems Journal_, _16_(1), 55–78. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2575.2006.00208.x
- Paper reports a design science project  attempting to provide guidance for people developing DSS grounded i behavioral decision theory (theory of cognitive bias)
- Claims there as 37 types of bias
- Very long article, but contains lots of good research on how we could implement a DSS that
- One stage of their project is the  "construction of the design artefact: an evolutionary DSS development methodology that uses cognitive bias theory as a focusing construct, especially in its analysis cycles"

Cognitive Bias, Decision Styles, and Risk Attitudes in decision making and DSS
Phillips-Wren, G., Power, D. J., & Mora, M. (2019). Cognitive bias, decision styles, and risk attitudes in decision making and DSS. _Journal of Decision Systems_, _28_(2), 63–66. https://doi.org/10.1080/12460125.2019.1646509
- Decision Support Systems (DSS) are supposed to help improve decisions by acquiring and processing data and using it to guide decision making and help the user think more rationally.
- People have bias in their decision making that can lead to poor or less optimal decisions
- DSS can help reinforce biases to make better decisions
- Two conditions that influence a decision aid
	- Persons decision-making styles - the way in which people process and store info
	- Decision makers attitude toward taking or avoiding risks - decisions involving risk imply that the most optimal outcome is not guaranteed.
- Discusses briefly 6 articles in which there are weaknesses in DSS's

Augmented Human Mind: Case of Reasoning
https://hal.science/hal-02264940/document 
- A suggested "radical method to debiasing" using augmented reality. 
- "we made a first attempt to propose an approach of a system capable of augmenting the reasoning of his user."
- proposed system to to detect cognitive biases and change the environment as possibly with a smartphone or watch, HoloLens, etc. to modify the environment to debias situations.
