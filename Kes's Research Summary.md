**Addressing cognitive Biases in augmented Business Decision Systems**
https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08127
overview:

- How do algorithmic decision aids introduced in business decision processes affect task performance?
- Experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of presentation variants in reducing complacency bias. Results: found that optional presentation increases subjects' resistance to wrong recommendations. 
- "In the longer run, we envision that decision aids will be generalized in business decision systems, provided they are instrumented with tooling that continuously assesses their relevance and performance so as to mitigate risks while improving the productivity and quality of decision-making."

**Augmented Human Mind: Case of Reasoning**
https://hal.science/hal-02264940/document 
overview:

- A suggested "radical method to debiasing" using augmented reality. 
- "we made a first attempt to propose an approach of a system capable of augmenting the reasoning of his user."
- proposed system to to detect cognitive biases and change the environment as possibly with a smartphone or watch, HoloLens, etc. to modify the environment to debias situations. 

**Unconscious Other’s Impression Changer: A Method to Manipulate Cognitive Biases That Subtly Change Others’ Impressions Positively/Negatively by Making AI Bias in Emotion Estimation AI**
https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/24/9961
Overview:

- Using emotional estimation AI has shown to manipulate peoples' perceptions of others, which can be considered for altering cognitive biases. 
- " Viewing information that estimated others’ emotions more positively/negatively caused the phenomenon in which the user’s self-judgment was overridden and others’ impressions of emotions, words, and actions were perceived more positively/negatively."

**Wearable Reasoner: Towards Enhanced Human Rationality Through A Wearable Device With An Explainable AI Assistant**
https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3384657.3384799 Overview:

- " Human judgments and decisions are prone to errors in reasoning caused by factors such as personal biases and external misinformation."
- "wearable reasoner" is a wearable system that is capable of analyzing if an argument is stated with evidence or not/
- results show it enhances rationality in users
- Is not directly related to bias, however states that improving error in reasoning is related to biases in perception. 

**Overcoming financial planners’ cognitive biases through digitalization: A qualitative study**
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0148296322007445
Overview:

- "The purpose of this paper is to investigate cognitive biases among financial planners and, if and how, digital transformation through Artificial Intelligence (AI) can help overcome biases."
- results found that financial planners do struggle with cognitive biases when providing services. "digital transformation" using A.I. was shown to possibly help overcome the existing biases, when paired with the individuals own cognitive intelligence.
