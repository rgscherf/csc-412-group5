- In this paper, the authors investigate the efficiency of group decision-making in comparison to individual decision-making. While it is widely accepted that groups tend to make more accurate decisions than individuals, this study explores whether group decisions are also more efficient in terms of processing speed. To address this, the authors use a methodology called systems factorial technology.
- Two key factors are measured: Workload capacity (CAND(t)) focusing on correct responses.
- The assessment function of capacity (AAND(t)) considers the trade-off between speed and accuracy.

- The paper focuses on understanding the neural process of decision-making in the brain and how it influences the outcomes. The researchers developed a system that tracks decision-making in real time by decoding the activity of brain cells.
- The study involved monitoring the brain activity of monkeys as they made decisions, specifically identifying the direction of motion in animated dots. The researchers successfully revealed the monkeys' ongoing decision-making process in real time, including moments of indecision.
- The findings show that neural activity can provide insights into the decision-making process, even when the subjects don't express their decisions overtly. The study also demonstrated the ability to influence the monkeys' decisions through subliminal manipulations of the stimuli.
- This research opens up new avenues for understanding the intricacies of decision-making at the neural level and may have broader applications in cognitive neuroscience. The study highlights the potential for monitoring and interpreting covert cognitive states through real-time neural recordings and its significance in advancing the field of neuroscience.

Chapter 6 Models and Modes of Decision Making, Decision Making, Helmut Jungermann, in Encyclopedia of Applied Psychology, 2004 https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/decision-making
- The chapter provides an overview of various models and modes of decision-making. It covers the following key points:
- Decision-Making Theories: The paper discusses prescriptive and descriptive decision-making theories. Prescriptive theories offer formal rules for rational decision-making, while descriptive theories explain how people make decisions, often deviating from rationality.
- Descriptive Models: The paper covers the Subjective Equivalent Utility (SEU) model (1954) and Prospect Theory (PT) by Kahneman and Tversky (1979) to explain deviations from rational decision-making.
- Prospect Theory: Prospect Theory focuses on how individuals evaluate outcomes in terms of gains and losses relative to a reference point. It introduces the value function and decision weight function to explain choices that don't align with traditional utility theory.
- Image Theory: Image Theory, proposed by Beach in 1990, suggests that people optimize decisions based on compatibility with their goals and plans under specific conditions.
- Naturalistic Decision Making: The paper mentions naturalistic decision-making, which explores how individuals use their experience to decide in complex, high-pressure situations.
- Organizational Decision Making: The paper briefly touches on models of organizational decision-making, including classical rational models and behavioural models that consider limited information processing and outcome-satisfying strategies.

- The paper explores the decision-making approaches people take when making significant life choices, specifically in sentimental areas, like personal relationships, and work areas.
- The paper Investigates the extent to which people employ intuitive or rational thinking in making these life decisions, with the hypothesis that rational thinking is more involved in career choices, while intuitive thinking plays a larger role in sentimental choices.
- Examining the differences in how people recall and perceive the decision-making process, including factors such as:
	- the difficulty of the decision, 
	- the clarity of memory
	- the pleasantness of the decision-making process
	- overall satisfaction with the final choice, in both sentimental and work-life areas.
- The paper provides an analysis of the relationships between individual personality traits and the utilization of rational thinking and intuitive thinking as predictors for overall satisfaction with the life choices made in the two areas.
- The study highlights the role of emotions and intuition in sentimental decisions and the role of rational and deliberative thinking in career decisions.
- The paper acknowledges that real-life decisions are complex, influenced by various factors, and often made in social and emotional contexts. The research aims to shed light on the cognitive mechanisms behind these choices and how they relate to personality traits and emotional considerations.

- Reasoning: According to the paper, Western cultures tend to favour analytical thinking, focusing on individual objects and their attributes. On the other hand, East Asian cultures tend to utilize holistic thinking, considering context and object relationships.
- These cognitive styles may impact risk perception, judgment, and problem-solving in decision-making.
- Emotion: Emotions significantly influence decision-making across cultures.
- Cultural variations in emotional expression and emphasis on specific emotions lead to differing decision-making outcomes.
- Emotional collectivism can have a more substantial influence on group decisions.
- Value and Tradeoffs: Cultural factors influence the attribution of causality in decision-making.
- Personal values, the self, and dissonance can vary across cultures.
- Loss aversion, reference point adaptation, and tradeoff resolution are influenced by culture.
- Summary:
- Cross-cultural differences in decision-making encompass reasoning styles, emotions, and values.
- These differences impact risk assessment, emotional regulation, and the resolution of tradeoff dilemmas.
- Understanding these variations is essential for appreciating the diversity in human decision-making and addressing cultural context's influence on choices and behaviours.
