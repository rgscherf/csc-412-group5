Phillips-Wren, G., Power, D. J., & Mora, M. (2019). Cognitive bias, decision styles, and risk attitudes in decision making and DSS. _Journal of Decision Systems_, _28_(2), 63–66. https://doi.org/10.1080/12460125.2019.1646509

- Decision Support Systems (DSS) are supposed to help improve decisions by acquiring and processing data and using it to guide decision making.

- System should help user think more rationally

- People have bias in their decision making that can lead to poor or less optimal decisions

- DSS can help reinforce biases to make better decisions

- Two conditions that influence a decision aid

- Persons decision-making styles - the way in which people process and store info

- Decision makers attitude toward taking or avoiding risks - decisions involving risk imply that the most optimal outcome is not guaranteed.

- Discusses briefly 6 articles in which one said that there's weakness in current decision

  

**Mitigating cognitive bias with clinical decision support systems: an experimental study**

- Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) are used to help clinicians in their decision making by "providing targeted clinical knowledge, patient information and other relevant health information "

- Bias in clinical reasoning has been shown as a major source for diagnostic errors

- Proposes that a DSS that suggests possible diagnosis and provided info to mitigate cognitive bias could support doctors finding the correct diagnosis

- Crowley (2013) showed that technology could detect bias

- Found in their study that CDSS can mitigate availability bias and that it happens independently of the timing of support and medical experience of the users

- Neither Medical experience level or confidence level in the decision had a probability to change the estimate.

- Paper reports a design science project  attempting to provide guidance for people developing DSS grounded i behavioral decision theory (theory of cognitive bias)

- Claims there as 37 types of bias

- Very long article, but contains lots of good research on how we could implement a DSS that

- One stage of their project is the  "construction of the design artefact: an evolutionary DSS development methodology that uses cognitive bias theory as a focusing construct, especially in its analysis cycles"

  

**Cognitive Biases in the use of Computer-Based Decision Support Systems**

Arnott, D. (2005). Cognitive biases and decision support systems development: A design science approach. _Information Systems Journal_, _16_(1), 55–78. https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2575.2006.00208.x

- Claims there needs to be more research in methods that could effectively limit biases in DSS

- Proposes 3 Debiasing techniques:

- 1) Correcting flaws in the experimental design surrounding the decision task

- 2) demonstrating to decision-makers that the biases exist and teaching them to avoid them.

- 3) correcting for possible mismatches between decision-maker and task

- Results showed that bias was present in computer based decision support systems, their approach to debiasing by making people aware of the bias had no effect.

  
  

**Automation Bias in Intelligent Time Critical Decision Support Systems**

Cummings, M. (2004). Automation bias in intelligent time critical decision support systems. _AIAA 1st Intelligent Systems Technical Conference_. https://doi.org/10.2514/6.2004-6313

- Automation Bias - over reliance on decision support systems, causing the user to always think the computer is right.

- Has caused tragic accidents when people rely on technology too much for decision making

- Designers should be aware of the potential negative effects of increasing automation

- Future designs should aid human decisions, not totally replace decisions by humans

- May be important to note that decision technologies can also cause bias, in the process of eliminating bias.
