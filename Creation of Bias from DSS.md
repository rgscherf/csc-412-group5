## Cognitive biases and decision support systems development: A design science approach

- Claims there needs to be more research in methods that could effectively limit biases in DSS
- Proposes 3 Debiasing techniques:
	1) Correcting flaws in the experimental design surrounding the decision task
	2) demonstrating to decision-makers that the biases exist and teaching them to avoid them.
	3) correcting for possible mismatches between decision-maker and task
- Results showed that bias was present in computer based decision support systems, their approach to debiasing by making people aware of the bias had no effect.

## Automation Bias in Intelligent Time Critical Decision Support Systems

- Automation Bias - over reliance on decision support systems, causing the user to always think the computer is right.
- Has caused tragic accidents when people rely on technology too much for decision making
- Designers should be aware of the potential negative effects of increasing automation
- Future designs should aid human decisions, not totally replace decisions by humans
- May be important to note that decision technologies can also cause bias, in the process of eliminating bias.

## Automation Bias: Decision Making and Performance in High-Tech Cockpits

- "**automation bias**, a recently documented factor in the use of automated aids and decision support systems. The term refers to **omission and commission errors resulting from the use of automated cues as a heuristic replacement for vigilant information seeking and processing.**"
- Automation aids caused pilots to be less attentive to their decisions (including decisions made by aids), unless the pilot had taken steps to internalize a sense of accountability i.e. discipline for retracing their decision-making processes.
- Interestingly, pilots who blindly followed false signals from their cognitive aid software later 'remembered' seeing corroborating signals with their own senses.
